Basic handwriting classifier that was trained on the MNIST dataset. 

Upon opening the HTML file, the model starts training automatically. 
Once the training is complete, an alert indicates that the training has finished. 
After seeing the alert, you can draw an image on the canvas. This image can represent an article of clothing (like a T-shirt, shoe, etc.). 
After drawing the image on the canvas, you can click the "classify" button. 
This action initiates the processing of the drawn image through the trained model for classification.
